# Roll 3D 20
 An attempt to make a 3D roll20
 what if there was a way to host a dnd game online but unlike roll20 it was 3d?

This idea is to make an online platform which will take dnd maps,
and make them 3d, haven't you ever wanted to have a 3d tavern on your map,
so that characters can go actually upstairs without having to switch their
pages like on roll20? this also helps the dungeon master with things like
not having to make 2 maps for each building
